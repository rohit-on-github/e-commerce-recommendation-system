# Customer Personalization and Recommendation Engine for E-commerce

## Overview

This project demonstrates a scalable, end-to-end recommendation system designed to provide personalized product recommendations for e-commerce users. It includes customer segmentation, collaborative filtering, and content-based recommendation algorithms. This system leverages Azure's cloud capabilities for deployment and provides real-time data processing for dynamic, scalable recommendations, focusing on optimizing user experience.

## Features

- **Data Processing:** Efficient data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to handle large-scale customer and product data.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Segmentation using clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN) to identify customer segments for targeted recommendations.
- **Recommendation Engine:** 
  - Collaborative filtering to recommend products based on similar users’ preferences.
  - Content-based filtering to suggest items based on customer interests.
- **Deployment:** Deployed on Azure, making use of Azure Functions for serverless deployment and Power BI dashboards for real-time visualization.

## Data Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion:** Load and preprocess customer and product data.
2. **Data Transformation:** Clean and transform data into structured formats, ready for segmentation and model training.
3. **Customer Segmentation:** Perform clustering to group customers with similar profiles and purchasing behaviors.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Prepare features for both collaborative and content-based filtering approaches.

## Modeling and Recommendations

1. **Collaborative Filtering:** 
   - Used to recommend products by finding similarities in user purchase histories.
   - Implements matrix factorization or nearest neighbors for recommendations.
  
2. **Content-Based Filtering:** 
   - Recommends products based on product attributes or descriptions relevant to a user's browsing history.
   - Utilizes TF-IDF and cosine similarity for keyword-based recommendation.

## Deployment

- **API Integration:** Deploy the recommendation engine as a REST API using Flask.
- **Azure Functions:** Enable serverless, scalable deployment for low-latency recommendations.
- **Power BI Dashboard:** Visualize customer insights and recommendation performance with a live Power BI dashboard connected to Azure.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Clustering Algorithms:** K-means, DBSCAN
- **Recommendation Models:** Collaborative filtering, Content-based filtering
- **Cloud & Deployment:** Azure Functions, Flask, Power BI
- **Visualization:** Power BI for real-time dashboards

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Azure account for cloud deployment
- Power BI account for dashboards

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-commerce-recommendation-system.git
   cd e-commerce-recommendation-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application
1. **Data Processing and Modeling:** Run the scripts for data cleaning, segmentation, and recommendation modeling from `src/`.
2. **API Deployment:** Deploy the Flask app as a REST API.
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```
3. **Azure Deployment:** Follow the configuration instructions in the `deployment/` folder to deploy using Azure Functions.

## Future Enhancements
- **A/B Testing:** Integrate A/B testing framework to measure recommendation effectiveness.
- **Hybrid Model:** Combine collaborative and content-based methods for better accuracy.
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Incorporate streaming data for instant updates to recommendations.
